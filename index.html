                    Born in 1987, I was the youngest of three children. My parents always taught me the value of hard work and determination. Growing up, I never had a set career path, but I knew that no matter what I put my efforts into that I would go far. I graduated from Denair High in 2005 and attended Modesto Junior College, where I encountered a menagerie of different walks of life. My world would never be the same. It wasn't until a close friend of mine, suggested that I attend a climbing school in Idaho. Northwest Lineman College helped shape my mind and body even further. The rigors that I endured were worth the turmoil. Now, again, I expand my knowledge. In the winter of 2020, I began my coding adventure. At first, I felt completely lost at sea. After gaining my bearings, I was able to navigate properly.
